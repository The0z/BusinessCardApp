    <string name="business_des">Since 1996, MemoryExpress has established a leadership position as the premier destination for computer products and services.
        Starting from a humble beginning, we have grown into a multi-million dollar company with many retail locations across Canada. Our success is a result of all the people who walk through our doors each and every day â€“ our customers, our staff, and our vendor partners.
        100% Canadian owned &amp; operated, our customer base has grown exponentially from year to year through referrals and word of mouth.
        During this time, we have also achieved premier partnership levels with key vendors such as Microsoft, Intel, and AMD.</string>
